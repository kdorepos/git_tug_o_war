# Git Tug o' War

## A couple of things
1) These are not exactly a plug-and-play solution. These are workarounds for shops without CICD in place and just need a way to get code from Git to server. Be sure to check through the variables for changes needed to be made before you use them in your environment.
2) If you want to audit the git_pull.log, move it to another directory so that your logging solution, like Splunk (I'm biased, obv) can continuously monitor it.
